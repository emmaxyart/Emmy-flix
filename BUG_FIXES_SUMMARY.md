## Remaining Considerations

### Database Setup Required
- The application needs a PostgreSQL database connection
- Run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma db push` to set up the database
- Update DATABASE_URL in .env with actual database credentials

### API Configuration Required
- TMDB API key is included but should be verified
- AWS/CloudFront configuration needed for streaming features
- Upstash Redis configuration needed for rate limiting

### Features Currently Disabled
- User authentication and registration
- Download functionality (requires auth)
- User sessions and personalization

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test TMDB API connection with `/api/test-connection`
2. Verify movie pages load correctly
3. Test search functionality
4. Check responsive design on mobile devices
5. Verify error handling with invalid movie IDs

## Next Steps
1. Set up proper database connection
2. Test the application build process
3. Configure streaming service if needed
4. Re-implement authentication if required
5. Add proper error monitoring and logging
